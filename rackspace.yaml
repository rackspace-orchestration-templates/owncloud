  #### Getting Started
  If you are new to [ownCloud](http://owncloud.org/), check out their
  documentation on how to use the [web
  interface](http://doc.owncloud.org/server/6.0/user_manual/webinterface.html).

  #### Accessing your Deployment
  Use the ownCloud URL provided to access your deployment. You will get a
  certificate warning since it's self signed. Login with the ownCloud username
  and password provided.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
